# Contributor Guide

This repository is maintained using [projen](https://github.com/projen/projen).

## Local workflow

1. Use **Node.js 20 LTS**. Agents and human contributors follow the same steps.
2. After editing `.projenrc.ts` run `npx projen` to regenerate files.
3. Format all TypeScript and JSON files with `npx prettier --write`.
4. Lint with `npm run eslint` then run `npm test`.
5. Build the project using `npm run build`.
6. Commit changes using short presentâ€‘tense messages.

## Pull Requests

Pull request titles must follow the pattern `type[scope]: description`.
Allowed types are `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`,
`ci`, `perf`, and `codex` for automated updates. Use a short scope such as
`runner` or `docs` to clarify the area affected. Codex should use the `codex`
type so it is visible that the PR was generated by an AI. Commit messages should
use the same format. Reference the related issue using `Fixes #` in the body and
fill out the summary and testing sections of the template.

## CI

GitHub workflows execute `npx projen build` which performs linting, testing and compilation. Ensure the local steps above succeed before pushing.

## Documentation

Public API docs are generated with `npm run docgen`. Update them whenever exports change.
