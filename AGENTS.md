# Contributor Guide

This repository is managed manually without [projen](https://github.com/projen/projen).

## Local workflow

1. Install dependencies with `npm install` once after cloning.
   CI uses `npm ci` to ensure a clean install.
2. Format all TypeScript and JSON files with `npx prettier --write`.
3. Lint with `npm run lint` then run `npm test`.
   Test execution can take a couple minutes.
   If tests do not start, ensure dependencies were installed and Node 22 is active.
   If Jest runs out of memory, prepend `NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096`.
4. Build the project using `npm run build`.
   The same `NODE_OPTIONS` flag can be used when memory errors occur.
5. Commit changes using short presentâ€‘tense messages.

## Generated files

Do not edit files in `lib/` or `dist/` directly. Rebuild them using the project tasks.

## Pull Requests

Pull request titles must follow the pattern `type(scope): description`.
Allowed types are `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`,
`ci`, `perf`, and `codex` for automated updates. Use a short scope such as
`runner` or `docs` to clarify the area affected. Codex should use the `codex`
type so it is visible that the PR was generated by an AI. Commit messages must
use the same format. Include `Fixes #` with the related issue in the body and
fill out the summary and testing sections of the template.

## CI

GitHub workflows install dependencies with `npm ci` and execute `npm run build` which performs linting, testing and compilation. Ensure the local steps above succeed before pushing.

## Documentation

Public API docs are generated with `npm run docgen`. Update them whenever exports change.
